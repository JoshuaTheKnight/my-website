            <p>
                The Mass Effect trilogy is amazing. Each game has the ability to stand on its own, but once you combine
                them all together, they transform into this grand sci-fi quest to save the universe. I could easily put
                any of the games on here, but the one I love the most is Mass Effect 2.

        <section>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                The gameplay of Mass Effect 2 is a huge step up from its predecessor. When you start the game, you
                choose a class that grants you a set of abilities and the available weapons you can use. I loved using
                the biotic classes, which give you fun psionic abilities to dominate close-range engagements. Each
                mission allows you to bring two of your squad mates whom you can command to help you during battles. It
                is a simple yet enjoyable system that never gets old.

        <!--Sound and Music Section-->
        <section>
            <h2>Sound and Music</h2>
            <p>
                One of the biggest points you need to sell your sci-fi world on is the sound design and music choice,
                and Mass Effect 2 does this to great effect. Everything sounds futuristic in the best possible way. The
                guns sound punchy, the abilities are crisp, and the soundtrack has such a great futuristic vibe to it.
            </p>

        <!--Story Section-->
        <section>
            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>
                The entire story of this game revolves around gathering a crew to conduct an against-all-odds mission to
                destroy a base operated by a species called The Collectors, who have been abducting humans in outer rim
                colonies. My favorite part of this game is your effect on the story. The decisions you make throughout
                the story have lasting implications for the galaxy. In the final mission, you have full control over the
                strategy of the mission, and the lives of your crewmates rely solely on how well you plan the attack.

            <h2>Artstyle</h2>
            <p>
                It is very easy for sci-fi universes to feel the same, but Mass Effect does such a good job creating a
                style that is uniquely theirs. From the alien species to the architecture, everything looks nice and
                unique. I&apos;m especially a fan of how the armor looks.

        <section>
            <h2><em class="rainbow">FUN FACTOR</em></h2>
            <p>
                From the solid combat to the impactful story and engaging universe, Mass Effect 2 stands out as a
                masterpiece of immersive gameplay experiences. I fully recommend playing through the entire trilogy to
                experience this fun and deep universe.
