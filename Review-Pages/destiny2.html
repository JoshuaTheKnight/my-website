        <section>
            <p>
                Destiny is an MMO series that I have been playing for nearly a decade now. When I have no other game I
                want to play, this is always the fallback game that I can play with my friends.
            </p>
        </section>
        <!--Gameplay Section-->
        <section>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                The core gameplay relies on the class you choose to play. I main a Titan, which is a tank with
                melee-centered abilities, there are Warlocks who specialize in space magic, and finally, there are
                Hunters who specialize in mobility and gunslinging.<br><br>
                The moment-to-moment gameplay of Destiny 2 is unmatched in the realm of PvE shooters. Every aspect of
                it, from the gunplay to the unique abilities, is crisp and fun to use and has kept me engaged to this
                day.<br><br>
                The activities you participate in are set up in a way that allows you to jump into the game, play a
                couple of missions, and be out in a fair amount of time. This has become crucial for me as I have become
                busier recently. If I only have 30 minutes, I can still get a full experience out of the game.

            </p>

        <!--Sound/Music Section-->
        <section>
            <h2>Sound and Music</h2>
            <p>
                The developers of the game, Bungie, have made it clear that they put a lot of time into the sound design
                and music, and it shows. All the guns, grenades, and abilities feel powerful, and the music alongside
                them creates this aura of power that perfectly encapsulates the players&apos; strength.
            </p>
        </section>
        <!--Story Section-->
        <section>
            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>
                The lore of Destiny is expansive. I own 5 different books Bungie made that chronicle the many lore
                entries that have been created over nearly a decade. It is expansive and feels lived in. However, one
                thing that I am not a fan of is that a lot of story is tied to a limited-time seasonal model that you
                can miss out on if you don&apos;t play for a while. This creates a sense of FOMO that sometimes
                reluctantly
                gets me to play the game so that I don&apos;t get confused about the overarching narrative.
            </p>
        </section>
        <!--Artstyle Section-->
        <section>
            <h2>Artstyle</h2>
            <p>
                Even though this takes place in the far future, it feels less like science fiction and more like space
                fantasy, and that is largely due to the art style. The characters often time look medieval, with
                knightly armor and wizard robes. The worlds look beautiful, and the enemies look terrifying. It is a
                style that I cannot praise enough.
            </p>
        </section>
        <!--Fun Factor Section-->
        <section>
            <h2><em class="rainbow">FUN FACTOR</em></h2>
            <p>
                Everything about Destiny 2 screams fun, from the enjoyable gameplay to the social factor of playing with
                friends and meeting new people. I only wish that sometimes I didn&apos;t feel roped into the game due to
                the
                limited availability of story missions.
