                Final Fantasy 7 is a vast game with compelling characters and an amazing story. It is worthy of all the
                praise it gets. It is my favorite game in one of my favorite series of all time. I first played this
                game
                back in 2018 after being introduced to the series through Final Fantasy 15.

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                The gameplay of Final Fantasy 7 revolves around Square Enix&apos;s Active Time Battle system, which is
                a
                turn-based system that ditches the traditional sense of taking turns to move and instead gives each
                character an action timer that allows them to move when the timer gauge fills up. This creates an
                atmosphere
                of urgency because if you take too long, an enemy can attack multiple times. I enjoy this system because
                it
                tests my strategy under pressure and my ability to respond quickly to catastrophes.<br><br>
                Another high point of the gameplay is the Materia system. Materia acts like the skills in the game and
                is
                slotted into equipment to grant skills and magical abilities. Some Materia can be paired to create new
                abilities, like imbuing weapons with magic or allowing magic to hit all enemies simultaneously. It is a
                very
                in-depth system that allows for limitless build-crafting potential.<br><br>
                Beyond combat and build crafting, exploration plays a big part in the gameplay loop. You are given a
                massive
                open world to explore. Exploration is required to maintain a competitive level, find essential items,
                and
                even find new characters to join your party. I often found myself entranced by this exploration, whether
                it
                be spending hours at the Golden Saucer Casino or raising Chocobos.

            <h2>Sound and Music</h2>
            <p>
                Being a PlayStation 1 title, Square Enix was limited in what they could do for sound and music given the
                space requirement, but somehow, they managed to create one of my favorite game soundtracks of all time.
                Songs like “The Oppressed,” “From the Edge of Despair,” and, of course, “One Winged Angel” still remain
                as
                some of my favorite tracks in a video game.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>
                The main theme of Final Fantasy 7&apos;s story revolves around life and death. It focuses on preserving
                the
                life
                force of the planet, what it means to be alive, and dealing with grief. Those themes are handled
                beautifully
                and often left me in self-reflection throughout my playthrough. The protagonist, Cloud, seemed like a
                one-dimensional cool character initially. However, as his story unraveled, he morphed into a complex,
                tragic
                character that still found a way to persevere through everything that tried to bring him down. I could
                write
                pages about the rest of the cast, but to keep things concise, I will just say that every character had
                something interesting about them. The main antagonist, Sephiroth, still remains as my favorite villain
                in a
                video game ever.

            <h2>Artstyle</h2>
            <p>Once again, being a PlayStation 1 game, the art style is quite literally rough around the edges. Despite
                this, there still is a lot of character within the art. The enemies are unique, the environment uses a
                mix
                of images and 3d objects to create shockingly detailed environments, and the Chocobos will always only
                bring
                the art style up.
            </p>

            <h2><em class="rainbow">FUN FACTOR</em></h2>
            <p>
                With an engaging combat system, vast build crafting potential, and a story that managed to keep me
                hooked
                for well over 40 hours, it is no surprise that Final Fantasy 7 has a very high fun factor. The only
                places
                where I can see improvement lie in the limitations of the hardware at the time of development. This is a
                game that I recommend for everyone to try at least once.
