        <section>
            <p>
                While Final Fantasy 16 isn&apos;t fully out, there is a demo available, and I was so blown away by it
                that I
                wanted to mention it here.
            </p>

        <!--Gameplay Section-->
        <section>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                The gameplay was coordinated by one of the greatest action combat directors in the industry, and it
                shows. It is flashy, responsive, and extremely fun. I was only given a glimpse of what it can be, but it
                left me excited for what I will be able to do later on.<br><br>
                My favorite thing about the gameplay is the Eikon battles which are just Godzilla-tier monster battles
                between the core summons of the Final Fantasy franchise. The whole experience is cutscene level of
                polish, and it is such an enjoyable experience.

            </p>

        <!--Sound/Music Section-->
        <section>
            <h2>Sound and Music</h2>
            <p>
                The music in this game is mainly grand orchestral music that perfectly portrays the situation&apos;s
                tone.
                The Eikon battle music is loud and intense, and the moment-to-moment tracks are calm and respond to the
                tone of the conversations going on. The sound design is equally as good and sells the intense action
                combat.
            </p>

        <!--Story Section-->
        <section>
            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>
                The story of the game is my favorite part so far. It is a dark fantasy story akin to shows like Game of
                Thrones and books like The Witcher, and it finds a way to perfectly incorporate the Final Fantasy feel
                through this setting by making the core struggle about the scarcity of crystals which is the everyday
                power source of the entire continent. I get a distinct Attack on Titan feel through the Dominants, which
                are people who wield the power of the Eikons and can transform into them. The demo&apos;s ending left me
                speechless and shocked at how everything went down. I am eager to play the full game to continue.
            </p>

        <!--Artstyle Section-->
        <section>
            <h2>Artstyle</h2>
            <p>
                The art style of this game is impressively realistic through the power of the PlayStation 5. What I love
                most about this art style are the special effects used for magic and the Eikon battles. It&apos;s so
                large
                and explosive and showcases the raw power of these kaiju-like monsters.

        <!--Fun Factor Section-->
        <section>
            <h2><em class="rainbow">FUN FACTOR</em></h2>
            <p>
                This game checks most boxes of what I envision as a dream game. A dark medieval political thriller with
                flashy action combat and large-scale battles. If this game manages to keep the momentum set up in the
                prologue, it will easily be my favorite game of all time.
