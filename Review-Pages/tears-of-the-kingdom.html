                Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is a masterclass in building an exciting world that knows how to
                tie in players and direct them toward memorable locations to explore. It is my personal favorite Legend
                of Zelda game.
            </p>

        <!--Gameplay Section-->
        <section>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                The main pull of this game is the vast world to explore. Not only is there the base Hyrule from the
                previous game, but now there are sky islands and an underground area as big as Hyrule. There are so many
                places to explore, and with the new skills that allow you to fuse items and build anything your
                creativity allows, it feels like a large-scale sandbox environment. My favorite contraption I built was
                a car that used springs to imitate independent suspension. It also had 3 cannons on it, because why not?
            </p>

        <!--Sound and Music Section-->
        <section>
            <h2>Sound and Music</h2>
            <p>
                The sounds and music in the game are simple and beautiful. It is calm and serene while exploring and
                intense during boss fights. The soundtrack incorporates reversed chants into the Ganondorf-related
                tracks to create this added uneasiness into it, and I find that to be amazing and really solidified him
                as a threat.
            </p>
        </section>
        <!--Story Section-->
        <section>
            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>
                I found the story to be the most surprising part of the game. I did not expect it to be as dark as it
                was. One of the themes I got from the story was sacrifice and knowing when to rely on others. It is a
                simple story but much better than I expected it to be.

            <h2>Artstyle</h2>
            <p>
                The Nintendo Switch is an old console with dated hardware, yet that didn&apos;t stop Tears of the
                Kingdom
                from being a beautiful-looking game. It is heavily stylized, which works in its favor. I couldn&apos;t
                help
                but notice how pretty the game looked while traversing the sky islands.
            </p>

        <!--Fun Factor Section-->
        <section>
            <h2><em class="rainbow">FUN FACTOR</em></h2>
            <p>
                The highlight of this game is obviously the gameplay. It is a fun time to explore the beautiful world
                and use expansive sandbox elements to build devices that solve the many puzzles the game throws at you.
                Weapon fusion was an amazing feature that allowed for so many possibilities regarding weapon choice. The
                only thing drawing this game back is the limitations of the hardware it is on. Regardless, Tears of the
                Kingdom is a wonderful experience, and I recommend it greatly.
