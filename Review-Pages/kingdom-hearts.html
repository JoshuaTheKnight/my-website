        <!--Introduction Section-->
        <section>
            <p>
                It is a no-brainer that Kingdom Hearts would appeal to me as a kid. It mixed Final Fantasy and Disney to
                create a fun and silly world that taught the importance of friendship. Kingdom Hearts 2 took everything
                great about the original and bumped it into high gear.
            </p>

        <!--Gameplay Section-->
        <section>
            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <p>
                The gameplay of Kingdom Hearts 2 is the best in the series. The action combat is almost at a fighting
                game level of polish and is easy to learn but hard to master. Most enemies can be defeated easily
                enough, but there are some secret bosses that will test everything you know about mechanics. My favorite
                boss fight in the game was the optional Sephiroth battle because it was extremely challenging. It took
                me many attempts, but finally beating him was the greatest feeling ever.
            </p>

        <!--Sound and Music Section-->
        <section>
            <h2>Sound and Music</h2>
            <p>
                Like most Square Enix titles, their focus on music leads to a masterfully made soundtrack. Dearly
                Beloved, Hollow Bastion, and Traverse Town are tracks that I listen to daily. I also enjoy the
                remixes of popular Disney tracks. The sound design is also great, with the menu navigation sounds being
                my favorite in any game.
            </p>

        <!--Story Section-->
        <section>
            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>
                I&apos;m not going to lie, the story is a jumbled and convoluted mess, but I find it to be charming. I
                don&apos;t
                think I would be nearly as entertained by the game if they switched their storytelling to a traditional
                format. It is so fun to see Sora, Donald, and Goofy fumble around different Disney worlds and pursue a
                large-scale threat. It is not a well-told story, but it is very fun nonetheless.

        <!--Artstyle Section-->
        <section>
            <h2>Artstyle</h2>
            <p>
                I appreciate the artstyle of Kingdom Hearts 2 a lot. It finds a way to take in a large amount of Disney
                IPs and form a style that aligns with all of them. I am also a huge fan of Keyblades; I think that is an
                awesome concept.

        <!--Fun Factor Section-->
        <section>
            <h2><em class="rainbow">FUN FACTOR</em></h2>
            <p>
                With fantastic combat, a goofy story, and a charming artstyle, Kingdom Hearts 2 is one of the most fun
                games I have ever played. It holds a special place in my heart because of how influential it was on my
                childhood. I have nothing but praise for this game.
